                <p>Walking on your own can be very therapeutic, but it is also an excellent social activity! Joining an

                    you

                <h3>EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT CULTURES</h3>
                <p>Choosing a hiking route in a new country or area exposes you to different languages, food and
                    traditions.
                    It is a perfect opportunity to step outside your familiar routine and expand your horizons.

                <h3>HEALTH AND WELL-BEING</h3>
                <p>Walking is an excellent way to maintain fitness and general health. Studies show that even a short
                    walk
                    outside for 20 minutes can reduce stress and boost your immune system. It also does wonders for
                    clearing
                    your mind and stimulating creativity

                <h3>SCENERY</h3>
                <p>The landscape around you is breathtaking. Often hiking trails take you to places only accessible on
                    foot,
                    allowing you to enjoy undisturbed natural environments.

                <h3>GO SOMEWHERE NEW</h3>
                <p>A hiking trip gives you a perfect opportunity to visit a new place around the world and combine it
                    with a
                    'theme'.
