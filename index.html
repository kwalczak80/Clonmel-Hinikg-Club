        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We are a group of people from Clonmel area who are passionate about hikinkg. If you think about joining
            our
            club please don't hesitate. There is no age restrictions, no sing ups or annual fees !!</p>
        <p>Just bring your self to join our family. Still not quite sure to join? Here are some reasons why hikining can
            improve your life.</p>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h2>Health and well-being</h2>
            <p>Walking is an excellent way to maintain fitness and general health. Studies show that even a short walk
                outside for 20 minutes can reduce stress and boost your immune system. It also does wonders for clearing
                your mind and stimulating creativity. Thanks to its low-impact nature, it is also suitable for most
                abilities, and requires minimal equipment. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Learn something</h2>
            <p>Whether it is learning how to identify an unknown summit on the horizon, or a rare bird perched on a
                tree,
                there is always something to learn out on the trails. Multiple books and apps can help with
                self-learning,
                but there is something to be said for the knowledge and skills of a qualified guide to accelerate the
                learning process.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>A Different Kind of High</h2>
            <p>Hiking offers a different kind of high. A high not associated with drugs or alcohol or going out to the
                clubs and staying up all night partying. Hiking offers a surreal sense of accomplishment and an
                adrenaline rush. It increases your dopamine and serotonin levels (happy hormones) in a healthy way. Not
                only that, but there is no better feeling that feeling like you are on top of the world</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Nature bathing</h2>
            <p>Nature is benefits to health are well documented. The Japanese even have a term for it: Shinrin-yoko
                (taking
                in the forest atmosphere or forest bathing), with doctors prescribing it as a treatment for all kinds of
                health issues. Time spent in nature can be an excellent way of relaxing and uncluttering your mind.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Meet friends: old and new</h2>
            <p>NWalking on your own can be very therapeutic, but it is also an excellent social activity! Joining an
                organised walking trip can lead to new friendships through an inspiring shared experience. Something you
                can
                then plan to do as friends, with your family, independently, or on another group tour.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Challenges Your Limits</h2>
            <p>Hiking offers a sense of competition without competing with anyone else, only yourself. It is not a meant
                to be a race with the person hiking next to you, but rather an interpersonal challenge set to your own
                capabilities. It may not be a physical challenge for some, but also a mental, and spiritual challenge.
